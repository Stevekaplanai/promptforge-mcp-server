## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0

1. **Update Configuration**: The tool parameters have changed. Update any scripts or configurations that call PromptForge tools.

2. **Pattern Migration**: If you've created custom patterns, they need to be migrated to the new format:
   ```javascript
   // Old format
   {
     keywords: ["tax", "accounting"],
     enhancements: ["Be specific"]
   }
   
   // New format
   {
     triggerKeywords: ["tax", "accounting"],
     keywordWeights: new Map([["tax", 3], ["accounting", 2]]),
     features: ["financial"],
     enhancements: [
       { type: "clarity", value: "Be specific about requirements" }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Analytics**: The analytics structure has changed. Update any integrations that consume analytics data.

4. **Tool Names**: Tool names remain the same, but parameters have been enhanced. Review the new parameter options in the README.
