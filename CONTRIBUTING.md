* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Documentation

## Adding New Domains

To add a new domain pattern:

1. Add the pattern in `initializeDefaultPatterns()` method
2. Include trigger keywords and enhancements
3. Add examples in `getExamplesForDomain()`
4. Update documentation

Example:
```javascript
this.patterns.set('medical', {
  triggerKeywords: ['diagnosis', 'treatment', 'symptoms'],
  keywordWeights: new Map([
    ['diagnosis', 3],
    ['treatment', 2]
  ]),
  features: ['medical', 'analytical'],
  enhancements: [
    { type: 'clarity', value: 'Include medical terminology' },
    { type: 'constraint', value: 'Ensure medical accuracy' }
  ]
});
```
